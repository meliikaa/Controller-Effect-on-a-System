# Controller-Effect-on-a-System
This is to investigate effects of a controller on a system
**Overview**
This repository contains code and analysis to investigate the effect of a controller on a system by examining its gain, poles, and zeros. 
The goal of this project is to explore the fundamental concepts of control systems and understand how controllers influence system behavior.

**Introduction**
Control systems play a crucial role in various engineering fields, such as electronics, robotics, and aerospace, to maintain desired outputs and stability in response to varying inputs. 
The behavior of a control system is heavily influenced by its controller, which is responsible for adjusting the system's response to meet certain criteria.

In this project, we will explore the basic concepts of control systems by analyzing the impact of the controller's gain and pole-zero configuration on the overall system performance.
